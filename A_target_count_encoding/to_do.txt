3 way threshold plots

Consider randomization (random NA) - regular target encoding, but no overall mean in transform (NA instead at last level or transform only train, validation)
  Adjust blender code

Try non count threshold in Target+Count

Some SHAP - which hierarchy level is significant for test, holdout

Neural networks with threshold - SAVE FOR NEXT POST

Try randomization? -- SAVE FOR NEXT NEXT   

DONE

Do F loops to start for tc, tt

Maybe add similar chart for hierarchical vs non in script 14

A05 - compare level stats

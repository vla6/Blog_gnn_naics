Shapley - fix DGI plots
Also make nicer plots for paper


Shapley comparison
scatter - compare models, corr?  Interactions?  Main effects?
vs k for single feature (no hiearchy), TT only, maybe also TC


===
DGI Shapley

===
Shapley
 - remove encoding all NAICS, put in footnote NO
 - k loop for all hier?  also dgi all hier?
 - k loop for all-DGI cases?  YES
 
 - NAICS only with Target-Count, Thresh.  Make a table or k loop?
 
 - Train vs Test for all models ?
 
 Question format in writing
 "What about other model types?"
 "What about missing values?"

Consider randomization (random NA) - regular target encoding, but no overall mean in transform (NA instead at last level or transform only train, validation)
  Adjust blender code

Some SHAP - which hierarchy level is significant for test, holdout

Neural networks with threshold - SAVE FOR NEXT POST

Try randomization? -- SAVE FOR NEXT NEXT   

DONE

Do F loops to start for tc, tt

Maybe add similar chart for hierarchical vs non in script 14

A05 - compare level stats 

Try non count threshold in Target+Count

feature_order = ['menc', 'mhier', 'menc_all', 'tc', 'tt']
num_models = len(feature_order)
print_dict = {'menc': 'Target encoding (NAICS only)', 
                'mhier':'Hierarchical Blencing',
                'menc_all': 'Target encoding (NAICS hierarchy)',
                'tc':'Target+Count encoding',
                 'tt':'Target-Thresh encoding'}
